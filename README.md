The goal of my BI project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the video game sales dataset compiled by Kaggle user Gregorut (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales). It was generated by a scrape of [Vgchartz](https://www.vgchartz.com).

The dataset includes information on video games that have sold at least 100,000 copies, and can be conveniently downloaded from the Kaggle webpage provided. Through this analysis, I aim to gain insights into the video game industry and its market dynamics, identify key trends and patterns, and explore the factors that drive success in the industry.

The dataset contains variables (16598 rows x 11 columns) such us: 

+ Game's ranking
+ Name
+ Platform (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)
+ Year of release
+ Genre
+ Publisher
+ Sales in North America (in millions)
+ Sales in Europe (in millions)
+ Sales in Japan (in millions)
+ Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)
+ Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales
