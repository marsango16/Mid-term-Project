The goal of my BI project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the video game sales dataset compiled by Kaggle user [Gregorut](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales). It was generated by a scrape of [Vgchartz](https://www.vgchartz.com).

The dataset includes information on video games that have sold at least 100,000 copies, and can be downloaded from the Kaggle webpage provided. Through this analysis, I aim to gain insights into the video game industry and its market dynamics, identify key trends and patterns, and explore the factors that drive success in the industry.

The dataset contains variables (16598 rows x 11 columns) such us: 

+ Game's ranking
+ Name
+ Platform (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)
+ Year of release
+ Genre
+ Publisher
+ Sales in North America (in millions)
+ Sales in Europe (in millions)
+ Sales in Japan (in millions)
+ Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)
+ Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales

## Planning of the project

+ Download the dataset and perform a general analysis of the information.
+ Preparing and cleaning data, checking for errors, duplicates and missing values with Jupyter Notebook
+ Insert the cleaned data into Tableu and start exploring the data by creating tables and graphs to visualise the results.
+ Join data if necessary using additional files to enrich my analysis 

To conclude, for this analysis project is to identify future trends in the gaming industry and communicate those insights to stakeholders through an informative dashboard in Tableau.
