## Goal of the project
The goal of my BI project is analyse of the video game sales dataset compiled by Kaggle user [xtyscut](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xtyscut/video-games-sales-as-at-22-dec-2016csv). It was generated by a scrape of [Vgchartz](https://www.vgchartz.com).

The dataset includes information on video games that have sold at least 100,000 copies and can be downloaded from the Kaggle webpage provided. Through this analysis, I aim to gain insights into the video game industry and its market dynamics, identify key trends and pattern. 

The dataset contains 16719 rows Ã— 16 columns divided into numerical and categorical variables: 

+ Game's ranking
+ Name
+ Platform (PC,PS4, etc.)
+ Year of release
+ Genre/ category
+ Publisher
+ Sales in North America (Million of copies)
+ Sales in Europe (Million of copies)
+ Sales in Japan (Million of copies)
+ Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world
+ Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales
+ Critic_Score
+ Critic_Count
+ User_Score
+ User_Count
+ Developer
+ Rating

## Time planning of the project
+ Download the dataset and perform a general analysis of the information
+ Define the target variables to find insights and future trends 
  - Top 15 Publisher sales 2011-2015
  - Total sales by publisher 2011-2015
